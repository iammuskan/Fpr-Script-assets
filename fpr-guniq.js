<p>This is the most fundamental safety rule and the cornerstone of responsible gun ownership. Even if you have just unloaded a firearm, continue to treat it as if it contains live ammunition.</p>
<h3>Why This Rule Exists</h3>
<p>Human memory is fallible. People have been seriously injured or killed by firearms they believed were unloaded. By ingraining this habit, you eliminate the single most dangerous assumption in gun handling.</p>
<h3>Practical Application</h3>
<ul>
<li>Never assume — always verify the chamber is clear before handling</li>
<li>After clearing a firearm, continue handling it with the same care as a loaded one</li>
<li>If someone hands you a firearm, verify it yourself — never rely solely on their word</li>
<li>This rule applies equally in the field, at the range, and at home</li>

<li><strong>At the range:</strong> Downrange toward the target berm</li>
<li><strong>At home:</strong> Toward a concrete floor or exterior wall, away from people</li>

<p>Your trigger finger must rest along the frame, outside and above the trigger guard, until your sights are on the target and you have made a conscious decision to fire.</p>
<h3>The Sympathetic Grip Reflex</h3>
<p>Under stress, the human body causes all fingers to contract simultaneously. If your index finger is on the trigger during a startle or stumble, a negligent discharge can occur. This is physiological — not a character flaw — which is why the rule is so important.</p>

<p>Pressing the trigger straight rearward in a smooth, consistent manner without disturbing sight alignment. It is the fundamental most likely to limit your accuracy.</p>
<h3>Press, Not Pull</h3>
<p>Use "press" — not "pull." Pulling implies yanking. Pressing implies a controlled, deliberate rearward movement.</p>
<h3>Slack and Wall</h3>
<p>Most triggers have initial slack (free travel) before resistance at the "wall." Taking up slack before aligning sights and completing the press at the wall allows for more precise shots.</p>
<h3>Common Errors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anticipating recoil (flinching):</strong> Most common accuracy killer — pushing muzzle down before firing</li>
<li><strong>Heeling:</strong> Applying rearward pressure with the palm heel before the trigger breaks</li>
<li><strong>Jerking:</strong> Rapid, inconsistent trigger movement</li>
